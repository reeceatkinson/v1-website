### Introducing Electric Purple...

Electric purple is a theme that relieves and prevents eye strain by maintaining dark mode but also adding a pop of colour to developers workspaces.

### Hitting 100 installs...

Electric Purple is coming to 100 installs rapidly and I cannot wait to see how developers feel about it.

### What's Next?

By Dec 2022 I will be publishing a new theme (which is my favourite colour) Electric Blue. I will post an update about this very soon!

### Product Hunt

I launched on Product Hunt a while ago but any upvotes would still really help me!
